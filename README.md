BDD-test-app
============

A simple app to demonstrate Behavior Driven Development using a welcome message page, a web search, and a new rails app.

I had quite a bit of trouble with phantomjs but with Erik, Brook, and Sunny's help I figured it out.

This took 4 hours with 2.5 hours of phantomjs fiddling.

This has definately taught me the importance of correctly intalling dependancies.
